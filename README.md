# Advance Web Development

Welcome to my Advance Web Development repository! This repository contains JavaScript projects and notes from my web development class. Each project is organized by date to keep track of what was taught in class.

## Projects

**Jan 16, 2024**
- **[ExampleFunction.js](ExampleFunction.js)** - A basic function in JavaScript, usage of LET, CONST & VAR
- **[Hoisting.js](Hoisting.js)** - JavaScript behavior where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
- **[Shadowing.js](Shadowing.js)** - Local Variables can "shadow" global variables with the same name.
- **[TypeOperator.js](TypeOperator.js)** - The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.
- **[TypeCoercion.js](TypeCoercion.js)** - JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.

**Jan 23, 2024**
- **[Loops.js](Loops.js)** - Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
- **[For-In-Loops.js](For-In-Loops.js)** - The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object.
- **[Objects.js](Objects.js)** - Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
- **[ObjectConstructor.js](ObjectConstructor.js)** - The Object constructor creates an object wrapper.
- **[Array.js](Array.js)** - Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
- **[ArrayOperations.js](ArrayOperations.js)** - Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
- **[FunctionExpression.js](FunctionExpression.js)** - A JavaScript function can also be defined using an expression.
- **[ArrowFunction.js](ArrowFunction.js)** - Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.
- **[ErrorHandling.js](ErrorHandling.js)** - JavaScript try and catch. The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

**Jan 24, 2024**
- **[Hoisting2.js](Hoisting2.js)** - JavaScript behavior where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

**Jan 30, 2024**
- **[Timer.js](Timer.js)** - JavaScript timing events allow you to execute code at specific time intervals.
- **[setInterval.js](setInterval.js)** - The setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds).
- **[SynchronousCallbackFunc.js](SynchronousCallbackFunc.js)** - A synchronous callback is blocking. It means that the program execution waits for the callback to be called and executed.
- **[AsynchronousCallbackFunc.js](AsynchronousCallbackFunc.js)** - An asynchronous callback is non-blocking. It means that program execution doesn't wait for the callback to be called and executed.

**Feb 6, 2024**
- **[NPM-Server](NPM-Server)** - A simple server using Node.js

**Feb 7, 2024**
- **[NPM-Server](NPM-Server)** - Read and Write files using Node.js

**Feb 13, 2024**
- **[Stringify.js](Stringify.js)** - The JSON.stringify() method converts a JavaScript object or value to a JSON string.
- **[Parse.js](Parse.js)** - The JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string.
- **[EventEmitter.js](EventEmitter.js)** - The EventEmitter is a module that facilitates communication/subscription between objects in Node.js.
- **[RemoveEventListener.js](RemoveEventListener.js)** - The removeListener() method removes a listener from the listener array for the specified event.
- **[RemoveAllListeners.js](RemoveAllListeners.js)** - The removeAllListeners() method removes all listeners, or those of the specified event, from the listener array for the specified event.
